## PHP Basic Web Application
This application was a basic PHP Web Application that I was going through for fun.
PHP is a highly mature web language for helping build different flavors of web 
applications. It powers more than 35% of web apps on the internet as of the 
day this was published, thus warranted some research and thought.

Overall, this is a naive approach to building web apps since most frameworks
will handle much of the boilerplate that comes along with building an app
like what is demonatrated here. I do plan on iterating on this further 
as I track through Laracasts as I experiment more with this interesting
and sometime esoteric language.
